Derived and created python scripts as introduction to CFD; Laptop origin

As a simple way to start my MASc, I derived and created scripts to solve for 1D conduction (Steady, implicit/explicit transient) with
temperature, flux or convective BCs as well as 2D conduction (Steady, implicit/explicit transient) with different BC arrangements
(2D conduction in progress).
